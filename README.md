 The project was a simple calculator program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input. The problem it was solving was to create a user-friendly command-line calculator that allows users to enter expressions and receive results promptly.
 What I did well.
I correctly handled both integer and floating-point numbers by using the double data type for operands. 
I ensured proper input validation for division by checking if the second operand was zero.
Where I can Improve.
Implement additional error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values or unsupported operations). This would make the code more robust and prevent unexpected crashes.
I could break down the logic into functions, such as separate functions for each operation, input validation, and user interaction. This would make the code more modular, easier to read, and adaptable for future enhancements.
The most challenging part was Ensuring that the program correctly parses and handles different types of user input was likely challenging. You overcame this by carefully organizing the input sequence and ensuring proper validation checks, especially for division by zero.
Transferable Skills
Input Validation: The skills you developed in handling user input and ensuring its validity will be useful in any project involving user interaction or data processing.
Basic Error Handling: Learning to anticipate and handle errors gracefully is a critical skill that will apply to more complex programming tasks.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
Comments and Code Documentation: You added comments to clarify your changes and decisions, making the code easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand and modify.
Variable Naming: By using meaningful variable names, you ensured that the code is self-explanatory.
